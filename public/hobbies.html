        Hi everyone! As a child, I had a passion with soccer and it comes along
        with me so far. I keep my hobby by still playing soccer until now.

        Besides of my soccer. I also really want to spend time to 2-hours-code
        practices. I see this as a good habits. And, you know, when you do it
        regularly, it will be your nature one day. You will love it naturally
        and inevitablly. Therefore, I think that I will try to get it become my
        habit before it being my second hobbies.
